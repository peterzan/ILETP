# New Material

**(1/16/2026)**

This folder contains recently published design notes and reference documents that extend the ILETP project beyond its original scope. These materials focus on deployment topology, governance, orchestration mechanics, and operational trust in multi-model systems.

The documents are published together to provide both strategic framing and concrete implementation patterns. Some of the mechanisms described here are experimental or intentionally inactive in the current codebase, and are included for transparency, reference, and defensive prior-art purposes.

## **AI > SaaS — Intelligence Beyond Deployment (Revere)**

This paper examines why large-scale AI capability has not yet translated into proportional productivity and economic impact in enterprise environments, particularly in regulated and accountable workflows.

It argues that the limiting factor is not model quality, but deployment architecture, ownership boundaries, and governance assumptions inherited from SaaS delivery models. The paper introduces the concept of a **local cognition layer** operating inside real trust boundaries, and explores how orchestration enables coordination, validation, and accountability across edge, on-premise, and cloud tiers when required.

The paper synthesizes observations from multiple independent research institutions (MIT, Stanford, Wharton, Yale) and frames a structural shift toward intelligence as infrastructure rather than purely as software.

## **ILETP Ensemble Health Check Specification**

This technical note describes a concrete mechanism for validating and monitoring the operational health of a multi-model ensemble before and during deployment.

The health check focuses on:

* detecting systematic bias or misalignment,
* validating baseline reasoning stability,
* measuring divergence quality rather than suppressing it,
* ensuring ensembles are tuned for the operational domain rather than optimized generically.

The goal is to prevent silent failure modes, false confidence, and brittle deployments in systems where accountability and trust matter. The health check serves as a practical example of how orchestration can introduce measurable governance into distributed AI systems.

## **Synthetic User Proxy (SUP)**

The Synthetic User Proxy (SUP) is an early orchestration mechanism developed to enable cross-model conversational awareness under strict API role and turn-taking constraints. SUP injects ephemeral, machine-generated context messages that preserve attribution and conversational continuity across multiple AI systems while remaining compliant with vendor interface requirements.

SUP was validated in production but later removed from the active system to simplify testing, isolate orchestration variables, and reduce experimental coupling. It remains documented here as a reference design and defensive prior-art publication for multi-AI collaboration patterns.

All synthetic messages generated by SUP are transient, non-user visible, and never persisted or represented as human input. SUP functions strictly as a transformation and routing layer to maintain context integrity between systems; it does not impersonate users, modify source content, or bypass platform safeguards.

## (New 2/1/26) Ensemble Based Prompt Injection Mitigation for Multi-Channel AI Agents

This note explores **prompt injection as an architectural and governance problem**, rather than a purely prompt-level or model-level issue. It examines how **ensemble-based approaches** can be used to mitigate prompt injection risk by introducing redundancy, cross-validation, and role separation across models, without assuming any single model can be made fully robust. The material is intentionally theoretical and forward-looking, and is included here as a conceptual pattern that may inform future system designs rather than as a prescriptive or field-validated solution.

## (New 2/2/2026) Use Case: Governed Knowledge Ingestion for Agentic Systems

This use case examines how AI systems can safely ingest information from untrusted external sources without allowing that content to influence system behavior or execution. It focuses on separating data from directives at the point of ingestion, using structured extraction, verification, and escalation to reduce exposure to prompt injection and unintended control. The pattern is applicable to agentic and tool-enabled systems where governance, auditability, and pre-execution safeguards are required.

## **Scope and Intent**

These materials are intended to:

* document emerging architectural patterns,
* encourage open technical discussion,
* establish prior art where appropriate,
* and support experimentation in trustworthy multi-model systems.

They are not prescriptive production standards, and may evolve as the ecosystem matures.
