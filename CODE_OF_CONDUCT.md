# Code of Conduct

The goal is to make this project welcoming, respectful, and productive for everyone. All participants are expected to follow this Code of Conduct.

## 1. Purpose
A positive community encourages collaboration and reduces friction. This document outlines expected behavior and steps for reporting and handling unacceptable behavior.

## 2. Expected Behavior
Please be respectful and considerate in all interactions. Examples of expected behavior include:
- Be friendly and welcoming to newcomers.
- Use inclusive language and avoid assumptions.
- Give constructive, actionable feedback.
- Respect others' time and boundaries.
- Accept responsibility and gracefully apologize if you make a mistake.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:
- Harassment, intimidation, stalking, or bullying.
- Abusive, demeaning, or dehumanizing language.
- Discriminatory comments (race, gender, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, etc.).
- Sexual language or imagery in public spaces.
- Threats of violence or celebration of others' suffering.
- Repeatedly contacting someone who has asked you to stop.
- Posting others' private information without explicit permission.
- Deliberate disruption of discussions or blocking others from participating.

## 4. Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces (issue trackers, pull requests, discussions, chat rooms, social media posts when representing the project) and to behavior at project sponsored events.

## 5. Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it promptly:
- Preferred method: Email [codeofconduct@iletp.org].
- Alternative: Open a private issue titled "Code of Conduct report" and mark it confidential, or contact me directly.

When reporting, include:
- A description of the incident (what happened, where and when).
- Names or links to involved parties (if applicable).
- Screenshots or copies of messages, if available.
- Your contact information and whether you want the report to be confidential.

I'll acknowledge receipt of your report within 72 hours.

## 6. Enforcement
Reports are reviewed by me. Possible responses may include:
- Asking the offender to stop or issuing a warning.
- Temporary or permanent removal of contribution or communication privileges.
- Public or private apology.
- Referral to law enforcement if threats or illegal activity are involved.

Enforcement decisions aim to be fair, proportionate, and consistent. Confidentiality will be respected as much as possible.

## 7. Moderation and Appeals
If you disagree with the outcome of an enforcement decision:
- You may request a review by contacting [codeofconduct@iletp.org] and providing additional context.
- The review will be handled by me or a rotation of maintainers when/where feasible.

## 8. Attribution
This policy is based on common open-source community guidelines and adapted for this project. You may adapt and reuse this Code of Conduct for other projects.

## 9. Contact & Updates

- This Code of Conduct may be updated from time to time; the latest version lives in this repository.
