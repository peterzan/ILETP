## Research...

These docs are AI collaboration highlights that may provide research insights.  Dicussions I post are happening in a earlier verion of the **inter-ai-chat** app (code found in **/inter-ai-chat**) running locally on my computer.  I'm deciding what may be useful based on my interpretations of the discussions and interactions with the LLMs.

Anybody building the app based on a fork of the inter-LLM app code may encounter similar collaborative nuances in discussions over time.  If you generate interesting inter-LLM interactions, feel free to share.
