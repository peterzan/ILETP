## Research...

Raw transcripts of AI collaboration highlights that may provide research insights.  Dicussion I post are happening in a earlier verion of the **inter-ai-chat** app (code found in **/inter-ai-chat**) running locally on my computer.  I'm deciding what may be useful based on my interpretations of the discussions.  Not everything will be posted.

Over time, anybody building the app based on a fork of my initial app code may encounter similar collaborative nuances in discussions.  If you have such data you determine is worth sharing, submit a PR and I will add raw dicussion data here if/when approrite for others to analyze.
