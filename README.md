Inter-LLM trust.  With the **user** in control.

ILETP is an inter-LLM coordination platform that treats divergence as a **feature**, enabling models to interact, critique, and synthesize outputs with trust scoring and context continuity. It’s for people and organizations who need AI they can trust—not just hope is right.
