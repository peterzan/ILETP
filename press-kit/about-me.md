## About Me

I’m [Peter Zan](https://linkedin.com/in/peterzan), a product manager with more than fifteen years of experience guiding products from concept to launch across companies including Apple, Adobe, Palm, ACCESS, Kensington, and Hewlett-Packard. My career has centered on understanding complex systems, creating user-centered product visions, and leading cross-functional teams to deliver measurable global impact.

I am the creator of the Inter-LLM Ensemble Trust Platform (ILETP™), a research-driven framework for coordinating, critiquing, and verifying the reasoning of multiple, independent large language models. Although I am not a programmer by training, I developed two working prototypes of the platform, one in Python and one in Swift through AI-directed development, using Claude as the implementation engine while I focused on architectural design, constraints, and system behavior.

ILETP reflects my broader research interest in inter-agent reasoning, trust and provenance in AI systems, and the future of human-AI collaboration. I continue to explore how users remain in control of increasingly autonomous systems, and how divergence between models can be leveraged as a source of insight rather than noise.
