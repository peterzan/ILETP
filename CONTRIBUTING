# Contributing to ILETP™

Thank you for your interest in the Inter-LLM Ensemble Trust Platform (ILETP).  
This project is in its early "seed" phase — ideas, discussions, frameworks, and prototypes are welcome.

## How to Contribute

1. Start a discussion or open an Issue for ideas or questions.
2. Submit Pull Requests for improvements to docs or specs.
3. Propose use cases, mappings to other frameworks, or design thoughts.
4. Be constructive, collaborative, and curious.

### All contributions are welcome:
- Docs, writing, editing
- Research links or examples
- Architecture proposals
- Test or experiment ideas
- Policy connections or safety perspectives

## Collaboration Principles

- Assume positive intent.
- Challenge ideas, not people.
- Specs evolve over time — nothing is final.
- Diversity of perspective = strength.

## Before submitting a PR

- Check open issues to avoid duplicates.
- Keep scope clear and well-described.
- Major proposals should start as Issues or discussions.

## License & IP

By contributing, you agree that submissions become part of the open project.
